Sharecoin allows anyone to easily create their own continuous token.

Continuous Tokens are a new kind of token managed by bonding curve contracts, named as such due to how its price is continuously calculated. A continuous token has interesting properties, such as:

Limitless supply. There is no limit to the number of tokens that can be minted.

Deterministic price. The buy and sell prices of tokens increase and decrease with the number of tokens minted.

Continuous price. The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more than token n-1.

Instant liquidity. Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any time, the bonding curve acting as an automated market maker. A bonding curve contract acts as the counterparty of the transaction and always holds enough ETH in reserve to buy tokens back.

These properties are made possible through the use of bonding curves.

In the past few years, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have been the primary distribution method of the majority of token projects. Investors send Ether to a crowdsale contract to receive a corresponding amount of tokens once a funding goal is met (or have their contributions refunded.) The Token Generation Event is a one-time process at the beginning of a project’s lifetime.

In contrast, in continuous token models there is no ICO nor Token Launch. Instead of pre-selling tokens during a launch phase, the tokens are minted continuously over time through various means via our bonding curve contract. Tokens are minted as needed and used within the protocol when required. The network forms around the need of the token and dissolves when its utility or interest wanes.

This helps bootstrap a liquid exchange from the very early days of small-scale token communities. A common challenge in creating successful token-based communities is reaching a critical barrier where there are enough market participants to reach a liquid, healthy exchange of value. This is similar to the chicken-and-egg problem in market networks.

We hope this protocol will help individuals such as, content creators looking to attach an asset to their youtube channel, a group looking to raise money for a cause, or anyone who needs their vision backed by fully digital liquid security that seeks to better align stakeholders’ interests from day 1 for free.
